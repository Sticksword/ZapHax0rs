love this website..my go to every time i search for real estate in the area..  favorite realtor Dan Savino is very helpful and gives your all the space you need to make your own decisions concerning the very important activity.
I just started using. Naturally it is awkward. Why ask for feedback from a newbie?

Thank you for such a great site.  It is very informative and gives the buyer a great view of the property with pictures and descriptions.  Whatever anyone looking to buy could use in order to find a property will find a great resource here before contacting an agent!

Please provide subscription and non-based listings. Try to combine yourself with neighborhoodscout.com to provide more facts / data-sheets about a locality for a buyer / seller.
It is wonderful the way it is.
Nice
comps in the area
do not know
Add more medium and upper price homes but all is well.
Please stop putting foreclosure houses for sale... no one notices the foreclosure sighn
Add the ability to change realtors if you so choose. Somehow when I created my account a realtor was auto-assigned
It does not work.  Can't search waterfront homes.
I never make recommendations for services or applications.
This site is fine
More information on the properties without making calls. My time and yours is valuable and I don't want to waste it on properties that don't meet the criteria. Allow the search results to be narrowed. Example: amount of acreage. The national website is extremely slow unresponsive and gives totally irrelevant search results! This also affects data usage reducing the amount of time people can spend looking at properties they are actually interested in. The link Donny Anderson gave me to his website is much better but still needs to provide more info. Thank you.
only show listings that have pictures
I hate this new version! Why get rid of or change something that was working well?? I hate having to click on more links to get to what I want to see
Some listings are not shown. Realtor.com has them.
Fix the photos.  There is a narrow strip of the middle of the shot!
the map does not refresh listings when navigating. You have to change the city name each time and even still it does not show all listings that fit within the filters.  This is the most frustrating.  also
Add property tax information and HOA Fees on properties in the listings. Thank You.
map search
find me something with a big enough lot to park an rv
Not enough properties on the site.  Other realty sites I have looked at have more properties to look at and choose from.  You need to add more properties to your database.
ok later
Not sure how to rate you.  I have not been able to visit any property.
Ok
Saved house disappear when it is sold. Would be good to keep it for future references.
I did recommend and a friend of mine found their home and is about to purchase their first home.
The website is fantastic. I waiting to purchase my home from this site.
Nothing
nothing at themoment
sometimes slow
to make it easier for filter
I am particular about the number of garage spaces. It would be nice to have that as a filter option.
App is really bad.I've had to use other company's app's and then copy my information over to BHG.Very poor experience.
sending same homes over and over
n/a
pending homes listed below the active.
Awesome
When searching for homes the go back feature doesnt work very well
Nothing Love It
Great Website!
Changing search area is hard to find. Says i have 100 saved homes - but I can find a way to remove them.
Hello
Liked the old format better.  why change?
add rent information to listings
There are bugs in the apps where city zip code boundaries are not correct for certain areas. For example
The preview list of home should have a house description.  I hate the removal of the house description.
I think its great
Add to the property detail the name of the subdivision according to the tax assessment record
