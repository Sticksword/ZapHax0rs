24,More information on the properties without making calls. My time and yours is valuable and I don't want to waste it on properties that don't meet the criteria. Allow the search results to be narrowed. Example: amount of acreage. The national website is extremely slow unresponsive and gives totally irrelevant search results! This also affects data usage reducing the amount of time people can spend looking at properties they are actually interested in. The link Donny Anderson gave me to his website is much better but still needs to provide more info. Thank you.,0
